# Unvoid Logic Test - Scheduling Application

## Test Description

This test is part of the hiring process for the developer position. The goal is to implement a scheduling system where patients can book consultations with doctors, respecting the doctors' availability. The focus of the test is on scheduling logic, ensuring that a patient can only book a consultation when the doctor is available.

The project contains **5 tasks** located in the `src/` folder, each with a README explaining what needs to be done. The tasks should be completed in order as they may depend on each other.

You have **4 hours** to complete the test from the moment you download the project. The test will be evaluated based not only on the results of the automated tests but also on the quality of the code implemented. If you cannot complete all the tasks, you may still be considered based on your performance.

## Requirements

- **Node.js v20 or higher** installed.
- **Dependencies**: The `lodash` and `date-fns` libraries are already installed and can be used. Feel free to install any other libraries you may need.
- **Tests**: After implementing the required features, you must run the tests to ensure that everything is working correctly.
